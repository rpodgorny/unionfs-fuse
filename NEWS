  return -ENAMETOOLONG if the path is too long instead of simply
  using a wrong path
- new options "-o relaxed_permissions" and "-o hide_meta_dir"
- included the debian directory
- Properly check on rmdir() if sub-branches are also empty
- Always compile with debug code, but only enable debugging on request
- New option -o debug_file
- Lots of bugs fixed in BUILD_PATH()
- Improved search of white-out files
- Properly fix Debian Bug#509516.
- More debug output.
- Add syslog support without the risk of possible dead locks
- Use fuse big-writes (and reads) if available

0.25
- Alternate way to specify branches
- Minor fixes

- Build-in support to change the maximum number of open files
- Added recursive directory COW.
- relative paths: Critical bug fix, had been completely broken in 0.23

0.23

  default_permissions checks

0.22
- Fix a bug reported by Jens Hoelldampf <jens@hoelldampf.net>, in 0.21 cow
  didn't work for pathes.

- Add this NEWS file.
- Add a man page.

0.19
- Several copy-on-write fixes (readdir, unlink, rmdir, rename).

- Disable threadding, since our current permissions-model is not compatible
  with the NPTL implementation and the Posix-Thread model in general.
- Add supplementary group support.
